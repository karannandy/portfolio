        <h1>About Me:</h1>
        <p>Solving problems is something thats not an obstacle in the path of success for me, I view each problem as a fun challenge that will potentially end up teaching me something new, and solving that problem becomes that much easier when you look at it this way. My creativity combined with my logical thinking, helps me really find extraordinary solutions to these problems.
          I am currently a student pursuing a bachelors degree in Computer Applications, hoping one day I can put my skills to use to make this world a better place. During my school years, I have learnt various programming languages like Java, HTML and CSS, while also getting a deep understanding of Data Structures. Now, I have experience with the aforementioned programming languages and a few others: Python, Ruby, SQL and Javascript. A total of 6 years of programming has helped me become really good at logical thinking.
          My creativity however comes more from other forms of arts. I have been making music ever since I learnt how to play a guitar, about 8 years ago. Over the years, I have spent time bettering my skills at it along with a few other instruments like: Piano, Bass and Kalimba. Besides playing all these instruments, I am also affluent in recording and producing music by using Digital Audio Workstations like Logic Pro X and Ableton Live. I have released an album and have been featured in another album.
          Along with my musical skills, I also love to sketch and these two art forms combined have really helped me gain a different perspective to everything I do. From coding, to making music, to writing articles- they all have been influenced and all these skills have intertwined to develop the skills I possess today.
          I hope to use these skills in the internships and jobs that I apply for and give it my best effort.</p>
